CS: 322, Natural Language Processing, *Professor Jack Hessel*

Run the baseline (classifies using n-gram overlap) with:

```python
python baseline.py
```

Running this command will print and plot the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score of the baseline model.

Run the doc2vec classifier with:

```python
python doc2vec_paraphrase.py
```

Running this command will print the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score of the doc2vec model.
